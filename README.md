# About Me

A Full stack engineer adept in multiple fields looking into specifically being the best in Web Development. Still developing on UI/UX skills. Most of the projects are stored on a local FTP system since GitLFS doesn't want to upload projects. I love documentation and feel like it's one of the *Best* attributes. Commit messages don't make sense during the end stages of projects but will typically have documented and thorough checks completed on the code base before pushing to GitHub.
